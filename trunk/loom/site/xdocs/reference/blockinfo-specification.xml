        <section name="The BlockInfo File">
            <p>
                The BlockInfo file defines meta-information about a block, such
                as which services the block depends upon, and which services it
                can offer to other blocks.
            </p>

            <p>
                The BlockInfo file is an XML file.  It must be located in the same jar
                file as the block's implementing class.  It must have the same name
                as the block's class, with the extention <source>.xinfo</source>.  Thus,
                if you were looking up the BlockInfo for a block of class
                <source>com.biz.cornerstone.blocks.MyBlock</source>, you would look up the
                resource <source>com/biz/cornerstone/blocks/MyBlock.xinfo</source> in the
                jar file containing the block.
            </p>

            <p>
                Below is an example BlockInfo file:
            </p>
            <source>

&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>

&lt;blockinfo>

    &lt;block>
        &lt;version>1.2.3&lt;/version>
    &lt;/block>

    &lt;services>
        &lt;service name="com.biz.cornerstone.services.MyService"
                 version="2.1.3" />
    &lt;/services>

    &lt;dependencies>
        &lt;dependency>
            &lt;role>com.biz.cornerstone.services.Authorizer&lt;/role>
            &lt;service name="com.biz.cornerstone.service.Authorizer"
                     version="1.2"/>
        &lt;/dependency>
        &lt;dependency>
            &lt;!-- note that role is not specified and defaults
                 to name of service. The service version is not
                 specified and it defaults to "1.0" -->
            &lt;service name="com.biz.cornerstone.service.RoleMapper"/>
        &lt;/dependency>
    &lt;/dependencies>

&lt;/blockinfo>
            </source>

            <p>
                You will notice that the information in the BlockInfo file is separated
                into three main sections:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <source>&lt;block></source> element, which defines the name and version of the block.</li>
                <li>The <source>&lt;services></source> element, which defines the services the block provides.</li>
                <li>The <source>&lt;dependencies></source> element, which defines the services the block uses.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section name="The &lt;block> Element">
            <p>
                The <source>&lt;block></source> element specifies the name and version
                of the block.  The <source>&lt;block></source> element includes
                the following nested elements:
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
          <th>Element</th>

                        The version of the block.  Must be of the format
                        major.minor.micro, where minor and micro are optional.
                    </td>

                    <td>
                        The type of configuration schema provided with the block.
                        Possible values depend on the Configuration Validator
                        that Loom is using.  This value is ignored by the
                        default Configuration Validator.  Optional.

                The <source>&lt;services></source> element defines the services
                that the block can offer to other blocks.  This element is optional;
                A block can choose to not offer any services to other blocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <source>&lt;services></source> element should contain a
                nested <source>&lt;service></source> element for each service
                that the block provides.  The <source>&lt;service></source>
                element takes the following attributes:

            <table>

                        The service name.  This is the fully qualified name of
                        the service interface.  The block must implement this
                        interface.  The service name is also used to identify
                        the service in the BlockInfo files of blocks that use
                        the service (see below).

                        major.minor.micro, where minor and micro are optional.
                        Default value is 1.0.

                The <source>&lt;dependencies></source> element defines the services

                services to the block using the <source>ServiceManager</source>
                passed to the block's <source>Serviceable.service()</source> method.

            <p>

                service that the block uses.  The <source>&lt;dependency></source>
                element takes the following nested elements:

                    attributes:

                            be castable to this interface.  The service name is
                            also used to identify the service in the BlockInfo
                            file of blocks that provide the service (see above).

                The <source>&lt;role></source> element specifies the role that
                the service plays.  This must match the role name that the block
                supplies when it locates the service using
                <source>ServiceManager.lookup( role )</source>.
                The role name is also used in the
                <a href="assembly-xml-specification.html">Assembly File</a>,
                to identify the dependency when connecting the block to the
                services it requires.  The <source>&lt;role></source> element
                is optional, and the role name defaults to the service name.

                These interfaces are exported by Loom's management system
