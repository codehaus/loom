                This page lists applications that run on top of the Loom application kernel.
                Each of these applications applications are at different stages of development
                and evolution. Some of the "applications" are thin wrappers around existing
                products that make them capable of being managed from within Loom. While
                others are applications are assembled from reusable Blocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The applications that take the wrapper approach are building on the sucess of
                pre-existing projects on the Web.  These could be at Apache or from
                SourceForge, and are not forked efforts.  They all do varioations of the same
                thing - namely instantiate the pre-existing project's main bean and expose it
                via a service interface to other phoenix blocks.  Some like HypersonicSQL
                present no methods in their service interface, their who interface to the world
                is through it's socket listener and a JDBC library on the client side.  All of
                the wrapped products are still launchable via their normal 'main' method in
                standalone mode.  These can be said to be dual mode, even if the code for
                phoenix compatability is in our CVS rather than their depot.

                Hendrik Schreiber has an excellent web server that is servlet capable.  It comes
                with a block for use within Loom. As a demo, it is possible to build a SAR
                file to see the default webapp of Jo! running under Loom control.  Jo! is Open-Source
                (LGPL license).
