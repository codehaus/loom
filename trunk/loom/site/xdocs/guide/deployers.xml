        Currently deploying a server application under Loom is simply
        a matter of dropping the .sar file into the appropriate directory
        (<code>apps/</code>).
            </p>
            <p>
        If the hot deployment monitor is enabled (default), applications
        can be added, removed and updated in the <code>apps/</code>
        directory without restarting Loom.
            </p>

          This documentation describes the methods through which you can deploy
          Server Applications under the Loom kernel. It will be expanded as
          the system becomes more complete.
