    <section name="Introduction">
<p>The lifecycle demo shows only the calling of the Avalon lifecycle methods
under Loom control.  If you are not familiar with the Avalon lifecycle, please
refer to the 
<a href="http://avalon.apache.org/framework/reference-the-lifecycle.html">
Avalon lifecycle</a> documentation.</p>
<p>Do not forget that the lifecycle methods are optional.  You can implement
all of them, as this demo does, some or none of them.</p>
