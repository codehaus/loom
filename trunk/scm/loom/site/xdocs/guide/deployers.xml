      <p>
        Currently deploying a server application under Loom is simply a matter
        of dropping the .sar file into the appropriate directory (<source>apps/</source>)
        and restarting Loom. In the future there will be more advanced methods
        of deploying and undeploying Server Applications without restarting Loom.

        <p>
          This documentation describes the methods through which you can deploy
          Server Applications under the Loom kernel. It will be expanded as
          the system becomes more complete.
