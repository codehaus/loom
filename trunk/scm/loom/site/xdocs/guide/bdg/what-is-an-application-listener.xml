        An ApplicationListener is a component that is created before any other
        components in the application. It receives notifications at the start of Block creation, 
        after each Block is created, and when all blocks are created and the application is
        running.

        ApplicationListener components are created before any Blocks are
        created in an Application. They receive notifications before and
        after the Application is started and stopped.

      <p>
        Like normal blocks, an application listener can be <em>LogEnabled</em>
        and take configuration via <em>Configurable</em>.  The special feature
        is that it must implement <em>ApplicationListener</em> and implement
        the four methods that are a consequence of that (as well as four from
        <em>BlockListener</em>).  The following section in assembly.xml causes
        instantiation of the application listener.  It is exactly the same as
        that for <em>BlockListener</em>:

        &lt;listener class="pkg.MyApplicationListener" name="a-suitable-name" />
