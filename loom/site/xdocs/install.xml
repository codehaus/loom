    Loom runs on a variety of platforms that have installed the Java 2 Virtual Machine.
            </p>

            <p>
    Everything required to run Loom and develop Loom based products comes with the
    distribution. If you wish to help develop Loom then it is recomended that you
    obtain the full source tree from CVS or from the nightly builds.
            </p>

            <p>
	Loom uses
                <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> as the build tool.
	Please consult the online Mavan documentation if you are not familiar with it.
            </p>

            <p>
    To build Loom
            </p>
            <source>
cd loom
maven
            </source>
            <p>
    The
                <code>distribution/target/loom-[version]</code> directory will contain the
    distribution as it comes in the binary build.
