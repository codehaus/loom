    Loom runs on a variety of platforms that have installed the Java 2 Virtual Machine.
</p>

<p>
    Everything required to run Loom and develop Loom based products comes with the
    distribution. If you wish to help develop Loom then it is recomended that you
    obtain the full source tree from CVS or from the nightly builds.

<p>
    Execute the relevant platform specific script (build.[sh|bat]) in the base phoenix
    directory.
</p>

<p>
    Executing this script will create a <em>dist</em> directory within the Loom
    directory. The <em>dist</em> directory will contain the
    compiled class files packaged into jars.
