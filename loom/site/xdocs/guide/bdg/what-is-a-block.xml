            <p>In Loom, there are three component layers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Blocks</li>
                <li>Components</li>
                <li>Classes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                They represent ever narrowing views of a component based architecture.
                The best analogy is that of hardware.  In the PC world, a Block would
                be like a PCI card, a Motherboard, a Case, or a Hard Drive.  A Component
                would be like the chips on the cards.  And classes would be like the
                individual transistors on the chip.  Granted, the actual economies
                of scale in this analogy don't hold to software (a component will
                not have millions of classes).

                A Block is a Component on a larger scale. It is usually the
                implementation of a Service. Examples of Blocks are
                "Persistent Object Store", "Connection Pools", "XML Database",
                "Authenticator" and so on.
