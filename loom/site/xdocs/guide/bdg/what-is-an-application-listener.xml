                An ApplicationListener is a component that is created before
                any other components in the application. It receives
                notifications at the start of Block creation, after each
                Block is created, and when all blocks are created and the
                application is running.

                ApplicationListener components are created before any Blocks
                are created in an Application. They receive notifications
                before and after the Application is started and stopped.

            <p>
                Like normal blocks, an application listener can be
                <code>LogEnabled</code> and take configuration via
                <code>Configurable</code>. The special feature
                is that it must implement
                <code>ApplicationListener</code>
                and implement the eight methods that are a consequence of
                that. The following section in assembly.xml causes
                instantiation of the application listener:

                &lt;listener class="pkg.MyApplicationListener" name="a-suitable-name" /&gt;
            </source>
