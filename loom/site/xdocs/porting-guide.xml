		<p>
		    Loom 1.0 supports applications running in Phoenix 4.0.x releases,
		    provided that the appropriate libraries are bundles in the sar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Compared to the Phoenix 4.0.x distribution, in Loom 1.0 distribution 
			some of the libraries in the <code>lib/</code> directory 
			have been removed as they are not used by the container. 
			If your app uses any of the excluded libraries, 
			you simply need to bundle them with the sar.  
		</p>		
	<subsection name="Comparison of libraries bundled">
