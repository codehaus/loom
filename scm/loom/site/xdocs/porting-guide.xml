		    Loom 1.0 is based on the (unreleased) Phoenix 4.1 codebase,
		    and has several enhancements over the Phoenix 4.0.x releases.   
		</p>
		<p>
			The main difference between the Phoenix 4.0.x and Loom 1.0 distributions
			is that some of the libraries in the <code>lib/</code> directory have 
			been removed in Loom as they are not used by the container. 
			If your app uses any of the excluded libraries, 
			you simply need to bundle them with the sar.  
		</p>		
		<p>
			Apart from library changes to the sar, you need not make any 
			further change.  Loom 1.0 is a drop-in replacement for Phoenix 4.0.x.
