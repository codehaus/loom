<section name="Extensible architecture">
    <p>Loom is written as an extensible micro-kernel. This allows you to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Customise behaviour quickly</li>
        <li>Plug in extra functionality effortlessly</li>
        <li>Remove unneeded functionality for a small footprint</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section name="Flexible environment">
    <p>Loom has native support for use in the following environments:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Command-line stand-alone program</li>
        <li>Unix daemon</li>
        <li>Embedded in other programs (including servlet engines)</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section name="Integrated management">
    <p>Loom enables JMX management of your software:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All aspects of phoenix itself are manageable, including
        startup/shutdown, deployment, management and logging.</li>
        <li>Applications running in phoenix are manageable, exposing
        their lifecycle (configuration, startup/shutdown, etc) and
        everything else you mark as manageable.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section name="Ease and speed up application development">
    <p>Loom is a container for (server) applications. It can host
    multiple applications within the same JVM, while keeping them securely
    isolated from each other.</p>

    <p>Loom provides simple XML configuration files that allow you to
    rapidly assemble a customised server applications from readily available
    components (called blocks).</p>

    <p>Loom provides the following services to hosted applications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lifecycle management</li>
        <li>Configuration management and persistence</li>
        <li>Resource management and sharing</li>
        <li>Management exposure through JMX</li>
        <li>Automatic (re)deployment</li>
        <li>An isolated environment</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Loom leverages the Avalon Framework, making it compatible with other
    Avalon-based projects like Excalibur and Cornerstone, enabling you to
    easily reuse their functionality.</p>
