        In Loom, a Server Application is a set of Blocks that act in concert
        to provide a unified user service. Example Server Applications include a Mail
        Server, File Server, Web Server etc. The Server Application is a high level
        component that contains a set of Block components.
            </p>
            <p>
        A Server Application requires a number of components other than Blocks to
        be complete. A Server Application requires configuration files to define
        Server Application wide settings (threading, security, logging), to define
        how blocks are wired together, and to define configuration data for the
        Block instances. A Block can also require other resources that are
        application specific.
