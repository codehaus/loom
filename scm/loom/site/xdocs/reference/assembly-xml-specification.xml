            <p>
                The <source>assembly.xml</source> file defines how to assemble the
                application.  It defines the blocks that make up the application,
                and how to connect them together.  It also defines the
                application listeners to include in the application.
            </p>

            <p>
                In previous versions of Loom, configuration data was also
                stored in the assembly file.  This is no longer the case;
                Configuration is now stored in a separate
                <a href="config-xml-specification.html">Configuration File</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The root element of the assembly file must be an
                <source>&lt;assembly></source> element.  The root element
                must contain a child element for each block and application
                listener which is part of the application.  These elements
                are described below.
            </p>

        <section name="The &lt;block> Element">
            <p>
                The <source>&lt;block></source> element defines a block, and
                how to provide services to the block.  The
                <source>&lt;block></source> element takes the following
                attributes:
            </p>

                    <td>
                        The fully-qualified name of the block's implementing class.
                        This class must be public, with a public no-args
                        constructor.  There must be a corresponding
                        <a href="blockinfo-specification.html">BlockInfo</a>
                        file for the class.

                    <td>
                        A unique name for the block.  This name is used to
                        refer to the block in other parts of the assembly file,
                        and in the configuration file.  The block name may
                        only contain letters, digits, '-' and '.'.

                    The <source>&lt;provide></source> element defines how to
                    provide a particular service to the block.  It connects
                    the block to another block that provides the required service.
                    There must be at least one <source>&lt;provide></source>
                    element for each dependency listed in the block's
                    <a href="blockinfo-specification.html">BlockInfo</a>
                    file.  For array and mapped services, there may be more than
                    one <source>&lt;provide></source> element for each
                    dependency.  The <source>&lt;provide></source> element takes
                    the following attributes:

                            to the target block.  This must refer to another

                            The role of the service.  This must refer to
                            one of the dependencies listed in the block's
                            BlockInfo file.  The service name and version
                            specified by the dependency must match one of the
                            services listed in the provider block's
                            BlockInfo file.
