          Loom can launch with alternate kernels.  Apart from the default
          kernel which is suitable for deploying in live scenarios, we
          supply a kernel which loads beanshell during startup.

        This allows pretty much anything to be done to applications
        and blocks once started.  As such it is not suitable for live
        deployment as it could be considered a bit of a hackers tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        The supplied commands are getblock, prtapps, prtblocks, resumeapp,
        rmvapp, startapp, stopapp and suspendapp.  With getapp, you can
        invoke any of the public methods on the implementation, including
        interacting with the block's methods from its service.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create a beanshell capable kernel, place the bsh-1.2b7.jar from
        <a href="http://www.beanshell.org/download.html">here</a> in the
        lib directory of phoenix before building it.  You will need to edit the
        'beanshell.jars' and 'kernel.impl.class' parts of the ant.properties file.
        You may also want to add your own convenience bsh scripts to the
        src/bsh/ directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, with a binary distribution of Loom, it is sufficient
        to just place the beanshell jar in the lib directiory of an unzipped
          Loom.  To enable it, edit conf/kernel.conf and change the kernel line
        to use the BeanShellKernel.
