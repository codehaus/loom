                Loom is a micro-kernel designed and implemented on top of the
                <a href="http://dna.codehaus.org">DNA</a> framework and supports components
                developed using the <a href="http://avalon.apache.org/framework/">Avalon</a> framework.
                In the future Loom will support DNA and <a href="http://picocontainer.org">Pico</a>
                components.
            </p>
            <p>
  		Loom provides a number of facilities to manage the environment of Server Applications.
  		Such facilities include log management, classloading, thread management and security.
  		In the future it will conditionally support extra facilities such as central server management,
  		server pools, and other facilities aimed at reducing the time to market.
            </p>
            <p>
		The API defines a standard method of piecing together server components and creating a server.
