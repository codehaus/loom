            <p>
              In Loom development, we identify several roles. Each of these has its own
       guide. If you plan to aid in the development of Loom itself, or if you are
       responsible for all these aspects, you should read all the guides. Otherwise, you
       should be able to learn everything you need to know from the guide that fits your
       role.

        <section name="The Administrator">
            <p>The administrator is responsible for getting Loom to run and for keeping it
            running. He typically controls the startup and shutdown of the standalone server
            or daemon, and uses a management console to keep the server in top condition.</p>

        <section name="The Deployer">
            <p>The deployer manages (un/re)deployment of the applications hosted withing Loom,
            typically through a management console. In real life, this is often the same person
             as the adminstrator.</p>

            <p>The assembler takes pre-written blocks and glues these together to create a

            <p>The block developer creates reusable components (called blocks) that can be
